# Introduction #

"The Art of NAV" is name I am using for all the initiatives around NAV and creating "best practices" and other documents helping NAV developers to create clear and clean code for Microsoft Dynamics NAV.


# Details #

Through the documents I am trying to describe different aspects of NAV developer live. Decisions and guidelines, Best Practices, etc. I hope that this "initiative" will help other developers (mainly beginners in the NAV world) to navigate through their work. These documents are not "rules without exceptions". ERP world is too complex to describe it in this way. Focus is on the core knowledge, general things, not specific problems and solutions. Some non-critical aspects will be ignored to keep the results as simple as possible, reader must still use his own brain to make final conclusion. These documents can just help him, guide him or recommend something. Result is responsibility of the developer.
